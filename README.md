## Project Description
The original dataset was found on Kaggle ([Link here](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition)) of 4242 images of flowers from 5 different types : Tulip, Rose, Sunflower, Daisy, Dandelion. The goal of this project was to play around and experience Computer Vision with these pictures of different dimensions in order to gain knowledge on CNN and to perform a classification of Flowers pictures. We will prepare our data, build CNN, test different parameters and see how well we can predict a flower class based on just the pictures ! 


## Workflow
1. Preprocessing the data
2. Build models
3. Compare the models
4. Try new predictions
